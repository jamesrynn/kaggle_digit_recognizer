# kaggle Digit Recognizer

We use CNN in Python to produce a solution to the kaggle competition 'Digit Recognizer' where we try to identify handritten digits in the set {0,1,...,9} from the [MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) provided as images of size 28 pixels by 28 pixels.


## To Do
1. Use data augmentation to expand the training set
 * (slight) rotations
 * zooming
 * shifts
 * stretches
 * blurring(?)
 
2. Add example images at the start and investigate correctly and incorrectly classified digits.

3. Look at confusion matrix

4. Convert from Jupyter notebook to .py files.
